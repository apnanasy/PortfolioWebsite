      <p>This is a little timer that I built to be used in a call center environment. It allows you to choose between an extended hold at 6 minutes and a regular hold at 3 minutes.
        Once the timer reaches 30 seconds it warns the user to check back in with their customer by flashing the buttons and timer yellow.
        once it has gone past the allotted time it will start flashing red.
         You can view the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/RiverVanCoder/pressit/src/master/">source code here</a> and click on the timer.js and timer.html files

      <p>This is a simple memory game that is 4 tiles that will light up in sequence and you have to click them in the correct sequence.
        The game uses BootStrap for the frontend and is written entirely in vanilla JavaScript. You can view the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/RiverVanCoder/pressit/src/master/">source code here</a>
